Dummy model example for the challenge, generating "predictions" of random floats between [0.0, 1.0).

This model used the Python template from [sample-model-templates](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks-Challenges/sample-model-templates).
Instructions on how to build and push the model up to Synapse are provided in its README.

Note: Dockerfile copies a file (`Leaderboard_set_Submission_form.csv`) that is not tracked
by this repo.  To download the file, please register for the challenge and access it from
the Files tab.
